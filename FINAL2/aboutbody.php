  images and videos of people performing the exercise to determine the correct posture for body of various shapes and sizes.
  In addition to testing, it provides ways to improve fitness and posture. It has a built-in daily schedule which has to be
  followed religiously to get good results. A timer of appropriate duration is also embedded into the exercises that are to be done.
